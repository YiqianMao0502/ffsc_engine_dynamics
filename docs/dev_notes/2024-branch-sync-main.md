# Main Branch Synchronization Log

This note records that the `main` branch has been fast-forwarded to include the latest
work from the earlier `work` integration branch (commit `1bb0f14`).

The update ensures that the default branch now exposes the full Chapter 2 component
implementations and supporting utilities introduced in that branch without further
manual merging steps.
